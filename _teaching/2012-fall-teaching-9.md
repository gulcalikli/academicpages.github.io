Students learn about qualitative and quantitative research methods. In this course, I lectured on data collection methods in field studies (e.g., interviews, questionnaires, shadowing, observation synchronized shadowing, participant observation, think aloud protocols), statistical analysis techniques, qualitative measures and construct validity.
